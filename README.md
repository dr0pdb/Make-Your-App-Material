<div style="text-align: center; "> <h1> XYZ Reader </h1> </div>

This is my fully functional Android-Project which i built taking the [Android Developers Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801). It was highly reviewed by a Udacity reviewer and was accepted as the final Project. The aim of this project was to take a fully functional app and implement material design on it so that it is beautiful and provides pleasing user experience.

## Instructions

The app is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.  

Why this Project?  
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an app’s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

What Will I Learn?  
Through this project, you will:  
 
+ Understand the fundamentals of Android design.  
+ Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
+ Separate an interface into surfaces.
+ Effectively use transitions and motion.

User Feedback for XYZ Reader:  

Lyla says:
“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”  

Jay says:
“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."  

Kagure says:
“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
